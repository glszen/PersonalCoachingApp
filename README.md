# Online Personal Coaching Program Web Application

This project is a platform that offers online personal coaching services. Users can select coaching programs, review package contents, compare prices, and choose an option that suits them to benefit from coaching services. On the admin side, the system is flexible, allowing for the addition, update, or deletion of packages. The project has been developed with a secure, flexible, and sustainable structure.

## Project Goal and User Experience

The main goal of this project is to provide users with easy access to their desired coaching programs. After signing up, users can view coaching packages through their personalized dashboard. These packages are structured with details such as content, price, and duration, making it easier for users to decide. Once they choose a package, users can begin benefiting from the coaching services.

## Admin Management and Flexible Package Structures

The admin panel is equipped with features that enhance the flexibility of the system. Admins can manage coaching packages, modify their content, and update prices. The system utilizes many-to-many relationships between packages and features, which allows for an adaptable and easily expandable structure. For example, one package can have multiple features, and a feature can belong to several packages.

## Technological Framework and Key Features

### 3-Layer Architecture
The project follows a three-tier architecture: Presentation Layer (UI), Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer. This structure makes the application more organized, maintainable, and ensures each layer focuses on its respective responsibilities.

### Many-to-Many Relationships and Database Design
The database is designed to include many-to-many relationships between packages and features, improving flexibility. This structure strengthens the database design and allows for easy scalability.

### ASP.NET Core and API Integration
The project uses ASP.NET Core to build a robust API infrastructure. Through the RESTful API, users and admins can interact with the system. The API supports fundamental operations like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

### Authentication and Authorization
Authentication is implemented to ensure users can securely log in. Additionally, authorization mechanisms ensure that users only have access to the data they are authorized to view. JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to enhance security for API requests.

### User Management
User management is handled either through ASP.NET Core Identity or a custom solution. This includes password security, role management, and access control.

### Error Handling and Middleware
Global exception handling is implemented to catch errors throughout the application and process them in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, middleware is used for security, authentication, and error management across the system.

### Model Validation and Security
User inputs are validated using model validation techniques to ensure their correctness and validity. Data Protection is used to securely encrypt and store sensitive user information.

## User-Friendly and Secure Experience

This project not only provides a user-friendly experience tailored to usersâ€™ needs, but it also offers significant advantages in terms of security and flexibility. Users can easily select coaching packages, while the system is designed to meet high security standards.

## Key Technical Features

The main technical features of the project include:

- **3-Layer Architecture:** Ensures the application is organized and easy to maintain.
- **Entity Framework and Code First:** Database management is handled through code, ensuring smooth integration.
- **Security with JWT:** User authentication and secure API requests.
- **Middleware Usage:** Efficient management of security and error handling.
- **Action Filters and Dependency Injection:** Improves the flexibility and sustainability of the application.
- **Unit Of Work and Repository Pattern:** Handles data access in a structured and efficient manner.
- **Global Exception Handling:** Ensures that errors are caught and users receive clear, actionable error messages.

## Conclusion

This project is a robust web application that facilitates the delivery and management of online personal coaching services. The system is designed with security, flexibility, and sustainability in mind, aligning with modern software engineering best practices.
